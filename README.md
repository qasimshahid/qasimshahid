- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Qasim! Welcome to my GitHub page, where I'll be posting mostly class projects for now, but hopefully personal projects sometime soon as well.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science as a Sophomore at George Mason University.

- ðŸŽ¸ My hobbies and interests include 70s-90s rock/metal music, Formula 1 (Go Mercedes!), and a fascination of all things related to space!
